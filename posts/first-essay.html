      <h2>I.And to begin</h2>
      <p>
        It’s quite hard to know what to write about when publishing your first
        essay. I feel the need to make this sound smart, intellectual, even
        academic, to show my position as a Marxist more than anything else, but
        I’m afraid that’s not going to be possible. <br />
        Because my writing stems from the need to express my love. My love for
        art, tenderness, for care, for being HUMAN. But those are the same exact
        things that make me a Marxist.

      <h2>II.I'd love to love</h2>
      <p>
        Interesting, as now at 21 years old, I’m choosing to pursue things that
        I wouldn’t have dared 10 years ago. I knit from time to time, for
        myself, not for others, not to sell my pieces, but to have something to
        do. I do it to honor a practice hundreds of years old, passed down from
        mother to daughter. I write, not to necessarily have this be my career,
        or to make money, but because I feel this strong urge to just get
        something out into the world. I live with this foolish hope that my
        writings can teach, can radicalize, can make YOU think about the world
        through another lens. I feel the need to preach about love, about
        dignity, things that can’t exist to their full potential under
        capitalism.

      <h2>III. But! (there’s always one)</h2>
      <p>
        Art, in its many forms can be resistance, but it can also be rest from
        the eternal and constant fatigue that capitalism places upon us. This
        can be art, anything can be art, and as long as it’s not profitable the
        bourgeoisie will not attempt to take it from me. <br />
        Literature and education are sacred, building blocks of any good
        society, of any good Marxist (and the anti-intellectual idea that STEM
        is the only good and viable career path that anyone should make just
        gives rise to the disgusting people in power, but that’s for another
        essay in the future maybe). <br />
        Care, for yourself and for others, is deeply political. It’s one of the
        things that the ruling class is trying to make you think shouldn’t
        happen. Care for yourself, things like taking time off, spending time
        with your loved ones, doing the things you love are being taken away,
        they don’t want you to have time to think and learn, and love, because
        that’s dangerous. Care for others is dangerous too, they want you to
        think that every person who does worse than you deserves it, it’s
        because they haven’t worked hard enough, hustled, grinded more! And of
        course, every person who does better than you on an economic level, they
        do deserve it! They’re smarter, work harder than you, and they’ve been
        good obedient dogs to the system. <br />
        Care for yourself is dangerous. Care for others is dangerous. To love is
        dangerous.

      <h2>IV. It’s our job (to do, to create, to love)</h2>
      <p>
        It’s in our hands, to do all the things that make us human, that don’t
        alienate us, that goes against the inhumane, cold and disgusting system
        that only wants us when it can steal the value of what we produce. So, I
        guess my first essay shall end (even though not planned) like my
        favorite poem from Paunescu, with a plead for the people to love each
        other, but doing it while reminding yourself that: <br />
        Politics without love becomes sterile. <br />
        Love without politics becomes naive. <br />
